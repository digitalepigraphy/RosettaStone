Abstract:This artifact depicts the depth map of the Rosetta stone, which was algorithmically generated in 2018 as part of the Digital Rosetta Stone project. The Digital Rosetta Stone is a project developed at Leipzig University by the Chair of Digital Humanities and the Egyptological Institute/Egyptian Museum Georg Steindorff in collaboration with the British Museum and the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology Project of the University of Florida. The aims of the project are to produce a collaborative digital edition of the Rosetta Stone, address standardization and customization issues for the scholarly community, create data that can be used by students to understand the document in terms of language and content, and produce a high-resolution 3D model of the inscription. The three versions of the text were transcribed and outputted in XML, according to the EpiDoc guidelines. Next, the versions were aligned with the Ugarit iAligner tool that supports the alignment of ancient texts with modern languages, such as English and German. All three texts were then parsed syntactically and morphologically through Treebank annotation. Finally, the project explored new 3D-digitization methodologies of the Rosetta Stone in the British Museum that enhances traditional archaeological methods and facilitates the study of the artifact. The results of this work were used in different courses in Digital Humanities, Digital Philology, and Egyptology.

====3D MODEL====
The 3D model was scanned on June 28, 2018 using Structure Sensor by Occipital in order to demonstrate our calculated depth map and normal map on the surface of its original artifact. The front face of the model has been mapped to the depth map and normal map that were algorithmically generated using Barmpoutis et at. MVA 21(6), 2010, pp.989-998. 
The 3D model is provided in OBJ format and the textures are provided in low resolition 4096x4096, and high resolution 8192x8192 versions. In addition we provide MLP (MeshLab) project files.

To allow high resolution rendering of the generated normal map in systems that support max resolution only 4096x4096, the front face has been split into 4 regions so that each can be textured using a 4096x4096 segment of the high resolution depth map and normal map.
